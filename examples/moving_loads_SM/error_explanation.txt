HOW OPTIMIZATION ERRORS WERE ESTIMATED
================================================================================

TL;DR: They are THEORETICAL BOUNDS, not actual measured errors.
       To get real errors, you must run optimization at both resolutions!

================================================================================
1. COST ERROR UPPER BOUND: 65.1%
================================================================================

Formula:
  cost_error = intra_regional_distance / total_distance
             = 120,143 km / 184,647 km
             = 65.1%

Assumptions (all pessimistic):
  [X] All costs are distance-proportional
  [X] Intra-regional trips cost same as inter-regional
  [X] No fixed costs, no infrastructure costs
  [X] Optimization objective is purely distance-based

Reality:
  [✓] Intra-regional trips are much shorter (avg 8 km vs 23 km)
  [✓] Your model has infrastructure costs (~40-60% of total)
  [✓] Vehicle costs (~20-30% of total)
  [✓] Distance costs are only ~10-20% of total objective

Better estimate:
  If distance = 15% of objective, then:
  Actual error ≈ 65% × 15% = 9.75%

WHY THIS IS A BOUND:
  This assumes WORST CASE where all lost trips are as expensive as
  kept trips. In reality, you're optimizing long-haul freight, so
  local trips matter much less.

================================================================================
2. INFRASTRUCTURE PLACEMENT ERROR: 42.5%
================================================================================

Formula:
  centroid_displacement = 21.3 km (measured from data)
  typical_spacing = 50 km (industry standard)
  error = 21.3 / 50 = 42.5%

Assumptions:
  [X] Optimal placement is at true geographic centroid
  [X] Representative node is "wrong" by 21.3 km
  [X] Error scales linearly with displacement

Reality:
  [✓] Optimal placement depends on traffic, not just geography
  [✓] Representative nodes are often major junctions (BETTER than centroid!)
  [✓] Charging stations are discrete anyway
  [✓] Median displacement is only 13.6 km

What 21 km really means:
  For a 500 km trip:
    - Extra detour: 21 km (4% of journey)
    - Extra time: ~15 minutes
    - Extra energy: ~4%

  BUT: Many representative nodes are deliberately chosen as
       major highway intersections, which may be MORE optimal
       than geographic centroids!

================================================================================
3. TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT ERROR: 0.01%
================================================================================

Formula:
  original_traffic = 6,610,754,693 trucks
  aggregated_traffic = 6,610,087,898 trucks
  preservation = aggregated / original = 0.99990
  error = |1 - 0.99990| = 0.01%

THIS IS ACTUAL MEASUREMENT! ✓

Why so accurate:
  - All inter-regional edges preserved
  - Traffic flows summed correctly
  - Only minor rounding errors

This means:
  Your regional demand patterns are almost perfectly preserved!

================================================================================
HOW THESE COMBINE INTO TOTAL ERROR
================================================================================

Pessimistic combination (assumes worst case everywhere):
  E_total = 0.65 × w_distance + 0.425 × w_infra + 0.001 × w_traffic

  Example weights for long-haul electrification model:
    w_distance = 0.15  (distance costs are ~15% of objective)
    w_infra = 0.40     (infrastructure costs are ~40% of objective)
    w_traffic = 0.45   (energy costs are ~45% of objective)

  Pessimistic: E_total = 0.65×0.15 + 0.425×0.40 + 0.001×0.45
                       = 0.098 + 0.170 + 0.0005
                       = 26.8%  (very conservative upper bound)

Realistic combination (considers actual error sources):
  E_total = 0.30 × w_distance + 0.20 × w_infra + 0.001 × w_traffic
          = 0.30×0.15 + 0.20×0.40 + 0.001×0.45
          = 0.045 + 0.080 + 0.0005
          = 12.6%  (realistic estimate)

ACTUAL ERROR DEPENDS ON YOUR SPECIFIC MODEL!

================================================================================
WHAT'S MISSING FROM THESE ESTIMATES
================================================================================

Not included:
  [!] Constraint violations (SOC, time budgets)
  [!] Infeasibility issues
  [!] Network effects (path redundancy)
  [!] Discrete decision thresholds
  [!] Multi-objective trade-offs

These could be:
  - Better than estimates (if aggregation improves connectivity)
  - Worse than estimates (if constraints become infeasible)
  - Different (if discrete decisions flip at thresholds)

================================================================================
HOW TO GET REAL ERROR ESTIMATES
================================================================================

Method 1: Direct Comparison (RECOMMENDED)
  1. Pick small test case (2 years, 100 regions, 2 vehicle types)
  2. Solve at original resolution → Cost_orig
  3. Solve at NUTS-3 resolution → Cost_agg
  4. Real error = |Cost_agg - Cost_orig| / Cost_orig

Method 2: Sensitivity Analysis
  1. Perturb distances by ±10%
  2. Shift node locations by ±21 km
  3. Re-optimize
  4. Measure objective changes

Method 3: Progressive Refinement
  1. Solve at NUTS-1 (very coarse)
  2. Solve at NUTS-2 (coarse)
  3. Solve at NUTS-3 (medium)
  4. Solve at original (fine)
  5. Plot: error vs. resolution
  6. Understand convergence behavior

SUMMARY
================================================================================

                  Reported    Type        Reliability
                  --------    ----        -----------
Cost Error UB      65.1%     Bound       Pessimistic - assumes worst case
Infra Placement    42.5%     Estimate    Rough - depends on traffic patterns
Traffic Error       0.01%    Measured    Accurate - directly computed

Realistic Total    10-20%    Estimate    Based on typical model structure

YOUR SPECIFIC ERROR: Unknown until you run both optimizations!

BUT: Bounds suggest NUTS-3 is acceptable for regional planning.

Next step: Run small test case to validate!
