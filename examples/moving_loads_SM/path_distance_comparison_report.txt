Traffic Data vs NUTS-3 Network Distances
================================================================================

RESEARCH QUESTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is there a difference in path lengths between the routes in truck traffic
data (original) and the NUTS-3 aggregated network?

METHODOLOGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Load truck traffic data with reported Total_distance
2. Load NUTS-3 aggregated network with edge distances
3. For each OD-pair, compare:
   - Traffic reported distance (from CSV)
   - Network edge distance (from NUTS-3 graph)
4. Calculate absolute and relative errors

RESULTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Total OD-pairs analyzed: 1,514,573

Network Connectivity:
  OD-pairs with DIRECT edge:    3,146 (0.2%)
  OD-pairs WITHOUT direct edge: 1,511,427 (99.8%)

Distance Comparison (Direct Edges Only):
  Mean traffic distance:       127.85 km
  Mean network distance:       26.64 km
  Mean absolute error:         102.88 km
  Mean relative error:         81.45%
  Median relative error:       87.12%
  Traffic-weighted error:      96.46 km

  Exact matches (< 0.1 km):    0 (0.0%)

KEY FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[!] MODERATE/HIGH error (>15% average)
    Significant differences between traffic and network distances.
    May need to review network edge distance calculations.

[!] MANY indirect routes (>50%)
    More than half of OD-pairs lack direct edges in NUTS-3 network.
    Paths require intermediate nodes (multi-hop routing).
    This is EXPECTED for sparse NUTS-3 aggregation.

INTERPRETATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The NUTS-3 aggregation creates a simplified network where:

1. 0.2% of OD-pairs have DIRECT connections
   - These use actual edge distances from the network
   - Average error: 81.4%

2. 99.8% of OD-pairs require MULTI-HOP routing
   - These use pathfinding (BFS) or fallback to traffic distance
   - More computation needed during preprocessing

ANSWER TO RESEARCH QUESTION:
YES, there is a SIGNIFICANT difference (>81.4% on average).
Network distances differ notably from traffic reported distances.
