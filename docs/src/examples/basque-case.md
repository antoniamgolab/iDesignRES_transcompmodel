# Basque case study

## Case study description
This case study encompasses

## Data sources
Data sources used for transport modes, and cost and performance parameters:
* ETISplus [1]: Within the project ETISplus, origin-destination data was calibrated at NUTS-3 resolution for all modes and both, passenger and freight transport.
* Grube et al., 2021 [2]: The authors provide a cost comparison between different kinds of vehicle types of passenger cars and drivetrain technologies.
